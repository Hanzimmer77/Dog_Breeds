# Dog_Breeds
This project focuses on classifying 120 dog breeds using the MobileNetV2 architecture. The model was fine-tuned on a dataset of over 10,000+ dog images, split into training, validation, and test sets. 

Leveraging transfer learning, MobileNetV2 was chosen for its lightweight structure and performance. The model was trained using the Adam optimizer and evaluated with categorical cross-entropy loss.

It achieves high accuracy in identifying dog breeds from images. 

This project is implemented using TensorFlow, and the trained model can be used to make predictions on new dog images.
